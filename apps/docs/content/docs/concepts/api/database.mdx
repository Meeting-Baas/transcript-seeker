**Transcript Seeker requires a database connection to store user data.** This is essential for managing calendar integration, which uses Better-Auth to store user information securely.

The current setup utilizes Drizzle ORM for database management, where it will store information like user details, sessions, and more.

  This applies specifically to the calendar feature. Other user data is stored
  locally in the browser using PGLite. To learn more, visit our [web database
  documentation](/docs/concepts/web/database).

## Database Configuration

To get started, set up a PostgreSQL-compatible database. We recommend using Turso for this purpose. Follow this [guide](/docs/guides/turso) for detailed steps on setting up a Turso database.

## Database Migration

To run a database migration, use the following commands:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm db:push
```

## Database Studio

To visualize the data in a user-friendly interface, use the command below:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm db:studio

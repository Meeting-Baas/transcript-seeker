## FAQ

Some common questions you may encounter.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion id='clean-workspace' title='How do I remove all node_modules and clean the workspace?'>
        To thoroughly clean the workspace, you need to remove all `node_modules` directories and clear any package caches. This helps eliminate any residual files or corrupted packages that may interfere with your app's functionality. Run the following commands:
        
        ```bash
        turbo clean
        pnpm clean:workspaces
        ```
        
        These commands will effectively clear the workspace and prepare it for a fresh setup.
    </Accordion>
<Accordion id='startup-issue' title="Transcript Seeker isn't starting. What should I do?">
    If `pnpm dev` is stuck and your application isn't starting, you may need to clean your workspace to remove any corrupted packages or residual files. Follow these steps:

    First, remove all `node_modules` directories and clear any package caches. This will ensure a clean setup:

    ```bash
    turbo clean
    pnpm clean:workspaces
    ```

    Next, reinstall the packages:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    Finally, install the Turbo CLI globally and start the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm install -g turbo
    turbo dev
    ```

</Accordion>

    <Accordion id='fix-monorepo-styling' title="I've configured the .env.development.local file, but my app still isn't running. What could be wrong?">
        Transcript Seeker utilizes `dotenv-cli` to load environment variables, simplifying the setup for different environments. Ensure that your `.env` files are correctly structured for the intended environment, as shown below:

        - `.env.development.local` for development builds
        - `.env.production.local` for production builds

        If your app is still not responding, make sure that the environment file is being loaded correctly. You can specify the environment by running this command:

        ```bash
        export NODE_ENV="development"
        ```

        Setting `NODE_ENV` ensures the app reads the correct configuration, aligning with the specified environment. This step is essential to avoid conflicts between development and production settings.

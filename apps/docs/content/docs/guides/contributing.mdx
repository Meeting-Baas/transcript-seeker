## Issues

Have you found a bug, got a suggestion, or stumbled upon something that doesn't work as expected? No problem! Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Meeting-Baas/transcript-seeker/issues). When submitting an issue, try to include a clear and concise title and as many details as possible. The more info you provide, the faster we can jump in and help!

## Pull Requests

We love pull requests! ðŸŽ‰ If you'd like to make a contribution, whether itâ€™s a bug fix, a feature, or a small improvement, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repo** to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** with a meaningful name:
   - For bug fixes: `fix/issue-123-bug-description`
   - For new features: `feat/awesome-new-feature`
3. Make your changes, and make sure you follow our [Conventional Commits](#conventional-commits) guidelines.
4. **Push your branch** to your forked repository.
5. Open a **pull request** from your branch to the `main` branch of this repo.
6. Before submitting, make sure your code is clean by running:
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   ```
   This will help catch any issues early on. ðŸš€

## Local Setup

Ready to jump into the code? Awesome! Please follow this [guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) to get started.

## Environment Variables

To learn more about configuring the environment variables, follow this [guide](/docs/concepts/environment-variables).

## Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to keep our commit history clean and organized. It makes it easier for everyone to understand what's been done at a glance. Commit messages should use the following format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

For example:

- `feat(homepage): redesign the layout`
- `fix(styles): correct position of server status`

Some common commit types:

- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation changes.
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.).

## Code Formatting

To keep the codebase consistent and readable, we recommend running a few checks before opening a pull request:

1. **Lint fixes**:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint:fix
   ```

2. **Run type checks** to ensure there are no type issues:
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   ```

Your code should be well-tested, clear, and follow our best practices. Remember, every contribution makes a difference, and we deeply appreciate your help in making **Transcript-Seeker** better! ðŸŽ‰

Thanks a ton for contributing, and welcome aboard! If you need any help, donâ€™t hesitate to ask. Letâ€™s make something amazing together. ðŸš€
